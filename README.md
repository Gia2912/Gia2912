👋 Greetings, please to meet you. I’m Chung Khanh Gia, a 4th year university student with programming knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in the business analyst field, as I think programming is not suitable for me, along with sitting all day in one place.
- 💞️ I'm looking for a company where I can contribute for the long term.
- 📫 How to reach me by Gmail: jmryu525@gmail.com
